# CNV-Analysis-Project-Summer-2019
CNV= Copy Number Variant
SNV= Single Nucleotide Variant

CNV Analysis Pipeline scripts to: 1) call CNVs from exome data, 2) identify CNVs within a gene panel, and 3) annotate called CNVs using population frequency data from gnomAD population

A script to extract SNVs from specific genes of a panel (in this case, 22 green/high evidence genes from the Severe Early Onset Obesity gene panel from the Genomics England PanelApp database) can be found in the SNV analysis folder
